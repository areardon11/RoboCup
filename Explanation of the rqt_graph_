Explanation of the rqt_graph:

As you can see in the graph the /usb_cam node publishes to the usb_cam/image_raw topic. ar_track_alvar, the node responsible for tracking the AR tags subscribes to this topic and publishes the processed data (location and orientation of the AR tags) to the /tf topic. object_tracker_red and object_tracker_gbo nodes, responsible for tracking colored objects, also subsribe to this topic and publishes the processed data (the coordinates of the colored object it is tracking) to topics of the form /zumy/[color] and object_tracker_red publishes this data also to /processed_image (to be able to visualize the red ball being tracked). the follow_ar_tag_twist node uses all of this information (by subscribing to /tf and /zumy[color] topics) to be able to start "robocup" and after processing the data it publishes instructions to the topics: zumyXY/cmd_vel and zumyXY/digital_out to control the zumy. zumyXY/cmd_vel is a topic that the zumy subscribes to know how to move. zumyXY_digital_out is a topic that the zumy subsribes to to know whether to turn on or off the electromagnet.
